Multiplayer Project

  Thank you for playing my game. It is called 'Sword and Scroll', where the two players compete to sell more items from their store in the allotted time. Players are given a list in the top corner of the item to sell and also how to get that item. The multiplayer should be working. It works by first connecting a host and then a client. The '?' box spawns to cover the other player's list, to cause more competition (and hide UI synchronization issues). All assets were free and downloaded online, and sounds play when a player interacts with an object, walks, or sells. The main controls are 'wasd', 'q', and 'e'. My inspiration was from the game 'Overcooked' :).


 Thank you for playing,
